<h1> Cami Cable Testing</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I developed a comprehensive testing suite for cables used in aerospace, military, and other high-stakes applications, serving clients such as NASA, Blue Origin, and various customer organizations. This suite ensures all cables meet strict electrical standards for reliability and safety. Key electrical tests performed include:

- **Continuity Testing**: Verifies that all electrical connections are intact, preventing open circuits or unintended shorts.
- **Hi-Pot (High Potential) Testing**: Applies high voltage to assess cable insulation integrity, ensuring resistance to voltage surges.
- **Insulation Resistance Testing**: Measures the insulation's resistance to prevent leakage currents and maintain proper electrical isolation.
- **Ohms Measurement**: Determines conductor resistance to ensure optimal performance within specified limits.
- **Amps Measurement**: Assesses the cables' current-carrying capacity to handle required electrical loads without overheating.
- **Voltage Testing**: Verifies that cables can safely carry designated voltage levels without degradation.

By automating these critical electrical tests, the suite enhances testing efficiency, minimizes human error, and ensures all cable assemblies comply with NASA, military, and customer-specific electrical standards essential for successful missions and operations.
